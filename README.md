# --Introduction--

Discover the art of extracting meaningful insights from data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL queries in Jupyter Notebook. Uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and trends within your dataset, and witness the transformation of raw data into actionable insights. Join us as we embark on a journey of data exploration and visualization, ultimately empowering informed decision-making.

# --Problem aimed to solve--

This project aims to tackle the intricate task of deciphering complex datasets by utilizing EDA with SQL queries in Jupyter Notebook. Through this approach, we seek to streamline data comprehension, enabling effective decision-making by uncovering valuable patterns and trends.

# --Data Description--

Our project is centered around the Olist E-commerce database, a comprehensive repository consisting of multiple interconnected tables. This rich dataset encompasses diverse aspects of the e-commerce ecosystem, including customer information, product details, order history, reviews, and more. With this multi-dimensional dataset as our foundation, we embark on a journey of exploration and analysis, leveraging SQL queries within Jupyter Notebook to uncover valuable insights that illuminate the dynamics of the e-commerce landscape.

# --Methodology--


Our approach revolves around a systematic blend of SQL queries and data analysis within the Jupyter Notebook environment. This structured methodology encompasses the following key steps:

Data Exploration: Delve into the Olist E-commerce database to understand the structure and content of the interconnected tables.

SQL Query Formulation: Craft targeted SQL queries to retrieve specific subsets of data relevant to our analysis goals.

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and transform the retrieved data, ensuring its suitability for meaningful analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employ SQL queries to perform exploratory analysis, including aggregations, joins, and calculations.

Insights Generation: Extract actionable insights and trends from the EDA results, unraveling patterns that shed light on customer behaviors, product performance, and business dynamics.

Visualization and Presentation: Visualize the extracted insights using Python libraries, enhancing data interpretation.

Power BI Integration: Transition to Power BI for interactive visualization, enabling dynamic exploration and storytelling.
