# --Problem aimed to solve-- 

This project aims to tackle the intricate task of deciphering complex datasets by utilizing EDA with SQL queries in Jupyter Notebook. Through this approach, we seek to streamline data comprehension, enabling effective decision-making by uncovering valuable patterns and trends.

# --Data Description--

Our project is centered around the Olist E-commerce database, a comprehensive repository consisting of multiple interconnected tables. This rich dataset encompasses diverse aspects of the e-commerce ecosystem, including customer information, product details, order history, reviews, and more. With this multi-dimensional dataset as our foundation, we embark on a journey of exploration and analysis, leveraging SQL queries within Jupyter Notebook to uncover valuable insights that illuminate the dynamics of the e-commerce landscape.

# --Methodology--


Our approach revolves around a systematic blend of SQL queries and data analysis within the Jupyter Notebook environment. This structured methodology encompasses the following key steps:

Data Exploration: Delve into the Olist E-commerce database to understand the structure and content of the interconnected tables.

SQL Query Formulation: Craft targeted SQL queries to retrieve specific subsets of data relevant to our analysis goals.

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and transform the retrieved data, ensuring its suitability for meaningful analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employ SQL queries to perform exploratory analysis, including aggregations, joins, and calculations.

Insights Generation: Extract actionable insights and trends from the EDA results, unraveling patterns that shed light on customer behaviors, product performance, and business dynamics.

Visualization and Presentation: Visualize the extracted insights using Python libraries, enhancing data interpretation.

Power BI Integration: Transition to Power BI for interactive visualization, enabling dynamic exploration and storytelling.

# Insight

**1. Monthly Order Volume:**
   - August consistently records the highest order volume every year.
   - July and May are the months following August with the next highest order volumes.

**2. Most Ordered Category:**
   - In most cities, the "Bed, Bath, and Table" category receives the highest number of orders.

**3. Payment Method:**
   - Approximately 74 percent of customers prefer using credit cards for payment when making their purchases.

**4. Highest Revenue Generating State:**
   - In the SP state, sellers have generated the highest revenue compared to other states.

**5. Highest Average Order Value by State:**
   - AC state holds the highest average order value at $181.7.
   - RR state follows closely as the second highest with an average order value of $168.2.

**6. States with the Highest Order Count:**
   - CE and SC states have the highest order counts compared to other states.


# Conclusion

In summary, the data indicates a recurring pattern of high order volumes in August, with "Bed, Bath, and Table" being the most ordered category in many cities. Credit cards are the preferred payment method for the majority of customers. The SP state leads in revenue generation, while AC and RR states have the highest average order values. CE and SC states top the list in terms of order counts.


# challenges Faced

In our EDA project centered on the Olist E-commerce database, we encountered several significant challenges. The dataset's complexity, with multiple interconnected tables, posed an initial hurdle, demanding a deep understanding of its structure.

Data cleaning and preprocessing were time-consuming due to the dataset's size and diversity, requiring meticulous attention to detail to ensure data quality.

Efficient SQL query formulation was essential for extracting insights from the extensive dataset, necessitating ongoing optimization to reduce query execution times.

Conducting meaningful exploratory data analysis with SQL queries demanded domain expertise and a meticulous approach to uncover valuable patterns.

Transitioning to visualization tools like Power BI presented integration challenges, requiring careful planning to create an interactive and insightful data representation
