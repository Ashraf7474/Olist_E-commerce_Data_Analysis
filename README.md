# Methodology
Our approach revolves around a systematic blend of SQL queries and data analysis within the Jupyter Notebook environment. This structured methodology encompasses the following key steps:

Data Exploration: Delve into the Olist E-commerce database to understand the structure and content of the interconnected tables.

SQL Query Formulation: Craft targeted SQL queries to retrieve specific subsets of data relevant to our analysis goals.

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and transform the retrieved data, ensuring its suitability for meaningful analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employ SQL queries to perform exploratory analysis, including aggregations, joins, and calculations.

Insights Generation: Extract actionable insights and trends from the EDA results, unraveling patterns that shed light on customer behaviors, product performance, and business dynamics.

Visualization and Presentation: Visualize the extracted insights using Python libraries, enhancing data interpretation.

Power BI Integration: Transition to Power BI for interactive visualization, enabling dynamic exploration and storytelling.

# Insight

**1. Monthly Order Volume:**
   - August consistently records the highest order volume every year.
   - July and May are the months following August with the next highest order volumes.

**2. Most Ordered Category:**
   - In most cities, the "Bed, Bath, and Table" category receives the highest number of orders.

**3. Payment Method:**
   - Approximately 74 percent of customers prefer using credit cards for payment when making their purchases.

**4. Highest Revenue Generating State:**
   - In the SP state, sellers have generated the highest revenue compared to other states.

**5. Highest Average Order Value by State:**
   - AC state holds the highest average order value at $181.7.
   - RR state follows closely as the second highest with an average order value of $168.2.

**6. States with the Highest Order Count:**
