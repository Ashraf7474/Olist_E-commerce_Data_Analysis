# Methodology
Our approach revolves around a systematic blend of SQL queries and data analysis within the Jupyter Notebook environment. This structured methodology encompasses the following key steps:

Data Exploration: Delve into the Olist E-commerce database to understand the structure and content of the interconnected tables.

SQL Query Formulation: Craft targeted SQL queries to retrieve specific subsets of data relevant to our analysis goals.

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and transform the retrieved data, ensuring its suitability for meaningful analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employ SQL queries to perform exploratory analysis, including aggregations, joins, and calculations.

Insights Generation: Extract actionable insights and trends from the EDA results, unraveling patterns that shed light on customer behaviors, product performance, and business dynamics.

Visualization and Presentation: Visualize the extracted insights using Python libraries, enhancing data interpretation.

Power BI Integration: Transition to Power BI for interactive visualization, enabling dynamic exploration and storytelling.
